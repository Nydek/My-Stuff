README file for the Dictionary ADT module and the related LibrarySearch program

The intstack ADT contains the following files:
README          This documentation file.
List.h          The header file that defines the ListHndl data type, the Node data type,
                and the functions of the List ADT.
List.c          An implementation of the List ADT that stores generic void * pointers 
                in each node.
Listdr.c        A driver program for the List ADT that tests the ADT's functionality.
Dictionary.h    The header file that defines the DictHndl data type, the KeyNode data
                type, and the functions of the Dictionary ADT.
Dictionary.c    An implementation of the Dictionary ADT that uses the List ADT.
Dictionarydr.c  A driver program for the Dictionary ADT that tests the ADT's functionality.
LibrarySearch.c A driver program that uses the Dictionary ADT to to create and fill a
                Dictionary with books and the library IDs of the libraries that have those
                books in stock. The Dictionary can then be searched and will print out the
                Library IDs of any libraries that have the searched books in stock.
Makefile        A makefile that complies multiple module and driver programs.
                It makes Listdr, Dictionarydr, LibrarySearch, List.o, Dictionary.o,
                Listdr.o, Dictionarydr.o, and LibrarySearch.o.

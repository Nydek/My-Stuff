@Copy this file into the student's directory:

Student's name:

Whenever a number in parens is given, assign a number between 0
and that max.  If less than the max, show a negative nuber and a
reason for the deduction.

Grader please make sure checksource.perl, cid, cc, javac, are in
your path.  Student's make is not responsible for fixing your path.

In student's directory:
   cp -R ../.score .

*****************************************************************

Program source code = 30 points.

   (3) general considerations.  program was called `pmake' as
       per specs the x bit was chmod'ed on

   (3) program appearance - checksource.perl did not complain -
       good choices for identifiers - decently readable
       indentation

   (3) Subroutines are used to break up the program into
       manageable pieces.  Program is not one monolithic
       monster.

   (3) Used Getopt::Std::getopts to analyze the options
       (or use GetOpt:Long:GetOptions instead, also OK)

   (3) Proper use of open with error checking for failure when
       opening the Makefile.

   (3) Sequences through -f option file or default Makefile in a
       reasonable manner.

   (3) Good use of regular expressions to scan and parse input
       lines

   (3) Uses hashes to hold dependencies.  Also uses hashes to
       hold variable names, builtin or otherwise.

   (3) Uses array references to hold prerequisites

   (3) Uses system() to run programs.  Checks $?>>8 after that
       to find out about return code.

   = program total /30
   NOTE: minimum program total is 1/30 if anything was submitted,
         and 5/30 if some junk that might be a start was submitted.

*****************************************************************

Testing the program = 30 points.

For each test, make sure you capture the output in a file so
students can see the result of testing.  Do a cp -R tests to
copy the test directory hierarchy into the student's directory.
If in doubt, check with gmake to see what is happening.

   cd into each of the test[i] directories and run the Check script.
   evaluate the results.

   (2) test0 - echo works?

   (4) test1 - 2 points for each test

   (4) test2 - assign 2 points if any one of the targets work.
               assign 3 points of two targets (log files) work.
               4 points if all targets work.

   (4) test3 - same comment as test2

   (4) test4 - same comment as test2

   (4) test5 - same comment as test2

   (4) test6 - output correct?

   (4) test7 - Does the -f option work and output same as gmake?

   = testing total /30

*****************************************************************

Add program + testing totals, giving:
SUBTOTAL=

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL1.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.

TOTALSCORE=
min 1, max 60

Check to see if they are working alone or doing pair
programming.  If pair programming, they should have a symlink to
their partner's directory.  If it is not there, you should make
one.

Make sure PARTNER is a symlink, not a file.  Example: charles
and ada are working together.
. dir charles/ should have a symlink PARTNER -> ../ada
. dir ada/ should have a symlink PARTNER -> ../charles

Grade only one partner's code and assign them the same score.

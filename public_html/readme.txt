Game: Blocked In

Instructions:
Move with arrow keys, use mouse to select level on menu screen.
Push blocks by running into them. When a numbered block hits a
numbered block with a lower number, it will break through it.
If a block runs into another block with a number value greater
than or equal to it, the block will stop moving. Try to reach
the portal at the end of each level to go to the next level.

Innovations:
The relationship between blocks based on their number value is
an innovative mechanic. It means that not all blocks are
equivalent and you must push blocks in the correct order, and
to the correct locations in order to beat the level. Other
special blocks and tiles are planned, but are not yet
implemented. We can use all these special mechanics to create
levels with more depth than you would find in other similar
puzzle games.
